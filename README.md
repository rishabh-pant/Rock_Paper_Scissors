**Project Title: Stone-Paper-Scissors Game**

**Description:**
This Java project implements the classic game of Stone-Paper-Scissors, allowing a user to play against the computer. The game demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, and user input handling.

**Features:**
- **User Input:** The player can choose between "Stone," "Paper," or "Scissors" via console input.
- **Computer Move:** The computer randomly selects one of the three options using Java's random number generation.
- **Game Logic:** The game determines the winner based on the traditional rules:
  - Stone beats Scissors
  - Scissors beat Paper
  - Paper beats Stone
- **Outcome Display:** The game displays the choices made by both the player and the computer, along with the result of the game (win, lose, or draw).
- **Replay Option:** The player can choose to play multiple rounds until they decide to exit.

**Technical Details:**
- **Language:** Java
- **Tools:** Java Development Kit (JDK), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as vs code or IntelliJ IDEA
- **Key Concepts:** Random number generation, user input handling, conditional statements, and loops.

**Code Highlights:**
- Utilizes `java.util.Random` for generating the computer's move.
- Utilizes `java.util.Scanner` for taking input from the user's .


**Challenges & Learning Points:**
- Gained hands-on experience with Javaâ€™s standard libraries and basic syntax.
- Enhanced understanding of random number generation and conditional logic.
- Improved skills in handling user input and providing interactive feedback.

**Future Improvements:**
- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing or JavaFX.
- Adding advanced features like score tracking or multiplayer options.
- Enhancing the AI for more sophisticated computer strategies.
